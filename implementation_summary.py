print("\n📋 REQUIREMENTS ADDRESSED:")

requirements = [
    "✅ On timeout, all output images from session are attached to original message as files",
    "✅ Each output image shown as embed with image preview (up to Discord's 10-embed limit)",
    "✅ Embed title/description indicates session has timed out", 
    "✅ All interactive UI components (buttons, selects, etc.) are removed/disabled",
    "✅ No additional user interaction required after timeout - automatic behavior",
    "✅ Handles case when no outputs were generated",
    "✅ Uses `await message.edit(...)` to edit original message with new embeds and attachments",
    "✅ Reference for output images via `self.outputs` storage mechanism",
    "✅ `self.message` reference to original message sent by bot"
]

for req in requirements:
    print(f"  {req}")

print("\n🔧 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:")

implementation = [
    "• ImageProcessingView class extends discord.ui.View with 30-minute timeout",
    "• OutputImage class stores image paths, prompts, and provides PIL Image loading",
    "• on_timeout() method handles all timeout logic as specified in pseudo-code",
    "• Interactive mode triggered by 'interactive' keyword in user message",
    "• Backward compatibility maintained for existing simple message processing",
    "• !test_timeout command for demonstration and testing",
    "• Comprehensive test suite validates all timeout behaviors",
    "• Error handling for edge cases (no outputs, file errors, etc.)"
]

for impl in implementation:
    print(f"  {impl}")

print("\n📝 CODE IMPLEMENTATION MATCHES ISSUE PSEUDO-CODE:")
print("""
Original pseudo-code from issue:
```python
async def on_timeout(self):
    for item in self.children:
        item.disabled = True
    files = []
    embeds = []
    for output in self.outputs:
        img_buffer = io.BytesIO()
        output.image.save(img_buffer, format='PNG')
        img_buffer.seek(0)
        file = discord.File(img_buffer, filename=output.filename)
        embed = discord.Embed(title="Final Output (Timed Out)")
        embed.set_image(url=f"attachment://{output.filename}")
        embeds.append(embed)
        files.append(file)
    await self.message.edit(
        content="🕒 Timed out! Here are all your output images.",
        embeds=embeds,
        attachments=files,
        view=None
    )
```

✅ Implemented exactly as specified with additional error handling and edge cases!

print("\n🧪 TESTING:")
print("  • test_timeout.py - Unit tests for all timeout functionality")
print("  • demo_timeout.py - Live demonstration of timeout behavior")
print("  • test_bot.py - Original tests still pass (backward compatibility)")

print("  1. Regular mode: @bot <prompt> (existing functionality preserved)")
print("  2. Interactive mode: @bot interactive <prompt> (new timeout-enabled mode)")
print("  3. Test mode: !test_timeout (demonstrates timeout with sample outputs)")
